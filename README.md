# Spaccanavi
Spaccanavi is my first game made with the Godot Engine.
It's a 2D top-down bullet-hell shooter with endless waves of enemies: the objective is to survive as much as possible.

I worked on this project for something like 3-4 months and, even tho could be expanded indefinitely, I think it's time to move on and work on something new :D
being my first game, it isn't as good as it could be; there are a lot of optimization opportunities and many more features that could be implemented, some of them at the end of this readme.

You can play the game here:

Some ideas are:

More Enemies!
- TriTank: an enemy like the Tank, but shoots 3 bullets at once
- MotherShip: an slow but heavy enemy ship that shoots other enemies, like chasers
- FrontShield: invulnerable from frontal attacks, the player has to outflank this ship to make damage 
- Spinner: a rotating spaceship that shoots plasma bullets very rapidly

[...]

More Guns!
It would be very cool to add different types of pickupable weapons. Some ideas:
- Shotgun
- Sniper
- Minigun (pushes back the player)

[...]

More Bullets!
Another cool ideas was to synergize different guns with different bullets type! Each one with unique characteristics. Some ideas:
- Boomerang (returns back to the player)
- Mines (stops in the spce and explodes when an enemy passes by)
- Fragmentation (on hit, it fragment into other smaller bullets!)

[...]

Damage types pickup!
Incendiary bullets, explosives, freezing bullets or even charmers bullets! This could add so much more value to the gameplay.
  
More types of Player's spaceships!
Initially I wanted to add different types of spaceships that the player could play with;
The base spaceship has some parameters that can be tweaked, and this could lead to some interestings variations like:
- More or less health
- More or less speed
- More or less mass!
- Tighter or looser controls

[...]


It would be really cool to see some of those features implemented in a future version of the game; so go on, I encourage you to fork this project and tweak a bit with the code!
Let me know if you came up with something interesting or even if you want to talk a bit about gaming :D


Thanks for your attention
